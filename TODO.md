## Audio Generation Enhancements

- [ ] Add inline timecodes during Mac audio generation for karaoke-style transcript sync
  - When generating audio from fountain scripts, output timing data (start/end timestamps) for each spoken line/segment
  - This enables synchronized "follow along" text display in the Daily Dao web player
